     * <ul>
     * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     *     an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method

     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link Object#equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
     * class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct
     * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
     * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
     * technique is not required by the
     * Java&trade; programming language.)

    /**

     * The {@code equals} method implements an equivalence relation
     * on non-null object references:
     * <ul>
     * <li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value
     *     {@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return
     *     {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
     *     should return {@code true} if and only if
     *     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
     *     {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then
     *     {@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
     *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
     *     information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the
     *     objects is modified.
     * <li>For any non-null reference value {@code x},
     *     {@code x.equals(null)} should return {@code false}.
     * </ul>

     * if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
     * ({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).

    /**
     * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning

     * will be true, and that the expression:

     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.

     *                                    support the {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses
     *                                    that override the {@code clone} method can also
     *                                    throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
